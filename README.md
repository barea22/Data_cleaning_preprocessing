# Data_cleaning_preprocessing
Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook! This project demonstrates my ability to clean and preprocess data using OpenML functions and pandas. The notebook showcases loading random datasets and applying various preprocessing and cleaning techniques to prepare the data for analysis or machine learning tasks.

Project Overview

In this notebook, you will find:

Loading data from OpenML.
Initial exploration of the dataset.
Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Normalizing/Scaling numerical features.
Removing duplicates.
Feature engineering.



Detailed Workflow

1. Loading Data from OpenML
Demonstrates how to fetch a random dataset from OpenML using the openml.datasets.get_dataset function.
2. Initial Exploration
Uses pandas to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
Performs basic exploration such as checking the shape, data types, and summary statistics.
3. Handling Missing Values
Identifies missing values in the dataset.
Shows techniques to handle missing values such as imputation or removal.
4. Encoding Categorical Variables
Converts categorical variables into numerical formats using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
5. Normalizing/Scaling Numerical Features
Normalizes or scales numerical features to standardize the data for better performance in machine learning models.
6. Removing Duplicates
Checks for and removes duplicate rows to ensure data integrity.
